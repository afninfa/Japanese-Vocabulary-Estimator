# Japanese Vocabulary Estimator

Estimate how many Japanese words you know with a margin of error.

Using the top 8000 words from the CSV file downloaded straight from https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-dictionaries. Some are not real words (for example "んだ" is in the list) but I've intentionally left it untouched.
